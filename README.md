# data-structures
Data structure is a process through which data is stored and arranged in the disk space of the computer or memory storage, in a way that the data can be
easily used and manipulated in the future. With a sufficient understanding of data structure data can be organized and stored in a proper manner. 
Data structures are designed to organize data in order to suit specific purposes so as to access and perform operations in an appropriate manner.<br><br>
Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.<br>
The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data 
will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an 
implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
<br><br>In this repository, it is shown to create abstract data types with the C programming language, to perform simple operations such as 
adding-deleting data, etc.</br><br>
